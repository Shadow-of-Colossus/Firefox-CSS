# Firefox-CSS

Updated Feb 27, 2020

This gives Firefox an older style appearance with security enhanced features in the identity box and location bar, it should work fine in v73.

I suugest you install a Firefox the like Black Abstract Fox... https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/black-abstract-fox/

You should install javascript functionality, here is how you do it....https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts

Then download this script that puts a favicon in the identity box... https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomJSforFx/blob/master/scripts/favicon_in_urlbar.uc.js

I've hidden the tracking protection icon but if you click it you'll get the tracking protection dropdown and the lock gives the site security info.

This is a mish-mash of my code and others I've collected and edited over time to acheive this. It uses @import in the userChrome.css file so it's easier to enable or disable features you want or not. I works well for me but it's a work in progress.
