# Firefox-CSS
This gives Firefox an older style appearance with security enhanced features in the identity box and location bar should work fine in v73. .

This is a mish-mash of my code and others to acheive this. It uses @import in the userChrome.css file so it's easier to enable or disable features you want or not. I works well for me but it's a work in progress.
